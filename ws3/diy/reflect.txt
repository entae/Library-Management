This workshop i got a lot more familiar with the std::cout function. In the beginning there was some trouble getting the format to output properly. However, after learning that the ios::right had to be unset since setf(ios::right) will override the setf(ios::left), most of the output format issues were solved. I also found out that I could use cout << left << “string”; to format my output as well if needed, which I found more intuitive to use. I was also able to implement a line function that I used in the previous semester’s ipc144 class to more easily print out lines where where there were no variables.

Another part I had trouble with in the beginning was when I was trying to use the classes with a namespace. So instead of using Food::setName, I was trying use namespace Food, but quickly realized that since Food was a class and not a namespace, it could not be used like a namespace.

This workshop also helped me see how initializing class members into empty states could be used by methods within classes so that undesired outcomes could be avoided. 

In the DIY, everything was very similar to the lab component of the workshop. Compared to the lab, one part I added was for changing the mealtime value into the desired string (ie. 1 = “Breakfast.” I achieved the outcome I wanted by using multiple ternary operators and was satisfied with the readability of the code, but if it seems hard to read, I know I could also use a switch statement.

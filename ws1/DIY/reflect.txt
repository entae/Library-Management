This was my first experience coding with C++. During the lab component, I was confused as to why my code was not working, because I had moved all the functions into the appropriate modules. I later realized that I did not implement a namespace "sdds", and I think this is something that I'll have to continue to remind myself to do as I start learning C++. 

For the DIY component, the coding seemed doable up till the "int strCmp(const char* s1, const char* s2)" function where I used multiple conditions within a loop to try and compare two strings. I found the "const char* strStr(const char* str1, const char* str2)" function the most challenging and struggled a little bit with how to set up the code so that the address of str1 would be returned if there was a match of str2. Working with pointers is still something that takes me a bit longer to comprehend and code.
However, it was very satisfying being able to reuse some of the functions within the cstring module within the other functions. Since I was advised to reuse my code in my ipc144 class, I kept an eye out for functions with similar mechanisms, and thankfully enough I could implement some of my code within the other functions to help reduce the number of lines I had to write.
